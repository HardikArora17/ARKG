## Overview

There has been growing interest in extracting, representing, and applying knowledge. In NLP literatures, both structured (e.g. Freebase, Wikidata) and unstructured (plain text) text have been used as knowledge sources. Knowledge from such sources plays an important role in advancing the state-of-the-art in various downstream tasks, such as question answering, generation and fact verification.

The objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers interested in effectively extracting, representing, and applying knowledge in various different ways. We promote discussions in related topics including but not limited to:

- The role of explicit structure in representing knowledge in the future
- Can language models be knowledge bases?
- How to effectively combine structured and unstructured knowledge?
- How to effectively combine external (explicit) and parameterized (implicit) knowledge?
- How to interpret knowledge that the models potentially have?
- Applications that make use of structured or unstructured knowledge
- Transfer learning for diverse knowledge sources


**Due to concerns about COVID-19, Workshop on Unstructured and Structured KBs will be fully virtual.**
